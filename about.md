My name is [Marco Herrero](http://marhs.de). I'm a software engineer from Sevilla, Spain.

I'm a MS student in artificial intelligence, computation and computer science. I've done things in several fields like cryptography, machine learning, games and web development. My [Github page](http://github.com/marhs) has some of these projects.
